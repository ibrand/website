        Suddenly, there's space in here.<br/>
        When I breathe in, the whole <span class="connection" data-link-id=2>atrium</span> fills and everywhere the air touches gently expands to receive it just like the edges of the universe.<br/>
        <span class="connection" data-link-id=3>I've never breathed like this before.</span>

        It becomes clear why I feel so fixated on the atrium in the first place,<br/>
        The conceptual capacious room filled with hard surfaces that echo when you speak inside it<br/>
        Was a roundabout way of imagining the <span class="connection" data-link-id=4>void of the universe</span> as finite, as reflective, as contained

        Ironically hearing myself attempting to "breathe deeply" on this track I hear how strained that concept was.<br/><br/>
        Mom tells me that I need to breathe from my diaphragm not from the shallow body of my lungs.<br/><br/>
        I am listening to the guitar tick like clockwork as I practice breathing. At that time, breathing in a trance. Living just a few inches outside the confines of my body in a overpowering place of dysphoric euphoria in a place of revelation, a direct conduit from the divine through me.

        <i>"What would it feel like to peer into that cup?"</i><br/>
        He asks me as I explain that my cup used to run over and now the water sits inside it like the lakes that pulled me over the finish line.<br/><br/>
        <i>"Back then, the divine used to flow straight through me, because I wasn't present enough to slow it down"</i> I say, <i>"these days, it pools up inside me and I have so much space to hold it in"</i><br/><br/>

        What does it mean to contain the universe?
